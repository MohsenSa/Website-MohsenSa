# Website-MohsenSa
Website that was launched on MohsenSa.ir (it's taken down now though)
It is a mimicry of the Website "projecteuler.net" (much more sophisticated though).
You can create an account,change your profile info from the "Profile" section of the website.
From the "Questions" section of the website, you can see programming challanges which you should find the answers to.
From the "Compiler" section of the website, you can write your code in any programming language you'd like and run it.In the compiler you can choose whether you want to write the code for a question(presented in the website) or you'd just like to code something irrelevant.If you choose to program for a question(presented in the website) and your code generates the right answer to the question, then in the "Answers" section of the website, the correct answer to the question(which you obtained) will be displayed.
